Explanation
Result Array:

Initialize an empty array result to store all permutations.
Backtracking Function:

Define a backtrack function that takes the starting index start as an argument.
Base Case: If start equals the length of chars, push a copy of chars to the result.
Recursive Case:
Iterate the elements from the current start index to the end of the array.
Swap the current element with the element at the start index.
Recursively call backtrack with the next index (start + 1).
Swap back the elements to backtrack and try the next permutation.
Initial Call to Backtracking:

Start the backtracking process by calling backtrack(0).
Return Result:

Finally, return the result array containing all permutations.
This approach can be generalized to any set of characters or numbers. Here's another example using numbers to further illustrate the concept.

Example Set: [1, 2, 4]
The permutations of the set [1, 2, 4] are:

[1, 2, 4]
[1, 4, 2]
[2, 1, 4]
[2, 4, 1]
[4, 1, 2]
[4, 2, 1]
Implementation in JavaScript
Let's use the same function with a different input set:

javascript
Copy code
// Example usage:
const nums = [1, 2, 4];
console.log(permute(nums));  
// Output:
// [
// [1, 2, 4], [1, 4, 2],
// [2, 1, 4], [2, 4, 1],
// [4, 1, 2], [4, 2, 1]
// ]
The permute function works the same way regardless of the input set, generating all possible permutations by recursively swapping elements and backtracking. This method ensures that each permutation is explored exactly once.
