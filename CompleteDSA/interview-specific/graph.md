Key Features of Graphs
Vertices (Nodes): The fundamental units or points in a graph.
Edges (Arcs): The connections between the vertices. Edges can be:
Directed (Arrows): Represented as ordered pairs (u, v), indicating a direction from u to v.
Undirected (Lines): Represented as unordered pairs {u, v}, indicating a bidirectional relationship.
Weighted Edges: Each edge has a weight or cost associated with it.
Adjacency: Two vertices are adjacent if they are connected by an edge.
Path: A sequence of edges that connect a sequence of vertices.
Cycle: A path that starts and ends at the same vertex with no other repetitions of vertices and edges.
Degree: The number of edges connected to a vertex. For directed graphs:
In-Degree: The number of edges coming into a vertex.
Out-Degree: The number of edges going out from a vertex.
Types of Graphs
Simple Graph: A graph without loops (edges connecting a vertex to itself) and multiple edges between two vertices.
Multigraph: A graph that may have multiple edges (parallel edges) between two vertices.
Weighted Graph: A graph in which each edge has a numerical value (weight) associated with it.
Directed Graph (Digraph): A graph in which the edges have a direction.
Undirected Graph: A graph in which the edges do not have a direction.
Connected Graph: An undirected graph in which there is a path between every pair of vertices.
Disconnected Graph: An undirected graph in which at least one pair of vertices is not connected by a path.
Cyclic Graph: A graph that contains at least one cycle.
Acyclic Graph: A graph without cycles.
Tree: A special type of acyclic connected graph.
Bipartite Graph: A graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that no two graph vertices within the same set are adjacent.
Complete Graph: A graph in which every pair of vertices is connected by an edge.
Graph Representation
Adjacency Matrix: A 2D array where the cell at row i and column j indicates the presence (and possibly the weight) of an edge between vertices i and j.
Adjacency List: An array of lists. The index represents a vertex, and the list at that index contains all adjacent vertices.
Edge List: A list of edges represented as pairs of vertices.
Common Graph Algorithms
Traversal Algorithms:

Breadth-First Search (BFS): Explores all vertices at the present depth level before moving on to vertices at the next depth level.
Depth-First Search (DFS): Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
Shortest Path Algorithms:

Dijkstra’s Algorithm: Finds the shortest path from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph.
Bellman-Ford Algorithm: Computes shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices, even if the graph has negative weight edges.
Floyd-Warshall Algorithm: Finds shortest paths between all pairs of vertices.
Minimum Spanning Tree (MST):

Kruskal’s Algorithm: Finds an MST by adding increasing cost arcs, avoiding cycles.
Prim’s Algorithm: Builds an MST by growing a single tree, starting from an arbitrary vertex and adding the cheapest edge from the tree to another vertex.
Topological Sorting: Orders vertices in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) such that for every directed edge uv, vertex u comes before v.

Strongly Connected Components (SCC): Identifies maximal subgraphs in which any two vertices are reachable from each other (e.g., Kosaraju's Algorithm).

Graph Coloring: Assigns colors to vertices so that no two adjacent vertices share the same color (e.g., Greedy Coloring).

Practical Examples and Applications
Social Networks: Representing relationships between users.
Maps and Navigation: Cities and roads, where cities are vertices and roads are edges.
Internet: Web pages as vertices and hyperlinks as edges.
Biological Networks: Modeling molecular structures and interactions.
Recommendation Systems: Representing users and items, and the edges represent preferences or interactions.
Task Scheduling: Using Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) for ordering tasks based on dependencies.

}

    addVertex(vertex) {
        if (!this.adjacencyList[vertex]) {
            this.adjacencyList[vertex] = [];

        if (this.adjacencyList[v1] && this.adjacencyList[v2]) {
            this.adjacencyList[v1].push(v2);
            this.adjacencyList[v2].push(v1); // Remove this line for directed graph
        }
    }

    bfs(start) {
        const queue = [start];
        const result = [];
        const visited = {};
        visited[start] = true;

        while (queue.length) {
            let vertex = queue.shift();
            result.push(vertex);

            this.adjacencyList[vertex].forEach(neighbor => {
                if (!visited[neighbor]) {
                    visited[neighbor] = true;
                    queue.push(neighbor);
                }
            });
        }

        return result;
    }

    dfsRecursive(vertex, visited = {}, result = []) {
        if (!vertex) return null;
        visited[vertex] = true;
        result.push(vertex);

        this.adjacencyList[vertex].forEach(neighbor => {
            if (!visited[neighbor]) {
                return this.dfsRecursive(neighbor, visited, result);
            }
        });

        return result;
    }

    dfsIterative(start) {
        const stack = [start];
        const result = [];
        const visited = {};
        visited[start] = true;

        while (stack.length) {
            let vertex = stack.pop();
            result.push(vertex);

            this.adjacencyList[vertex].forEach(neighbor => {
                if (!visited[neighbor]) {
                    visited[neighbor] = true;
                    stack.push(neighbor);
                }
            });
        }

        return result;
    }

}

Special Types of Graphs
Bipartite Graphs: A graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that no two graph vertices within the same set are adjacent. Can be checked using BFS or DFS.
javascript
Copy code
class Graph {
constructor(vertices) {
this.vertices = vertices;
this.adjList = new Map();
}

    addVertex(v) {
        this.adjList.set(v, []);
    }

    addEdge(v, w) {
        this.adjList.get(v).push(w);
        this.adjList.get(w).push(v);
    }

    isBipartite() {
        let color = Array(this.vertices).fill(-1);

        for (let i = 0; i < this.vertices; i++) {

                if (!this.bfsCheck(i, color)) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        return true;

                }
            }

            tempAdj.get(u).splice(i, 1);
            tempAdj.get(v).splice(tempAdj.get(v).indexOf(u), 1);
            this.eulerUtil(v, tempAdj, path);
